My name is **[Matt Jiggins](mailto:web@jiggins.ca)**. I'm a Canadian photographer, frontend designer-developer based in the **Netherlands**.

[I develop](#showcase-cpd) using WordPress, PHP, SASS, Ember, Node and BackboneJS.

This is my new website, still very much a work in progress. As of <date>February 17th, 2016</date> the site is running as a NodeJS app on an HTTP2 server with SSL certs provided by [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org). [View the source on github](https://github.com/mattjiggins/jiggins-node).
