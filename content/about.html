<p>Personal statements are always difficult to write. This is my attempt at describing what I&#8217;m looking for. If you&#8217;re looking for a classic biography <a href="/classic-biography">click here</a>.</p>

<p>I have worked for some <a href="http://www.cpd.utoronto.ca" target="_blank">great people</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Layton" target="_blank">visionary leaders</a>, <a href="http://www.usw.ca" target="_blank">meaningful and principaled organizations</a>. Where I go next needs to follow in these footsteps.</p>

<p>The best way to know what I can do is by looking at this site, and <a href="mailto:web@jiggins.ca">talking to me</a>. I have never needed to apply for a job in my entire life, work has always found me, and we&#8217;ve just become friends.</p>

<h3 id="whereiam.">Where I am.</h3>

<p>In 2007, after a decade in <em>&#8220;classic&#8221; IT management</em> with a <a href="http://ndp.ca" target="_blank">progressive Canadian political party</a>, I decided to setup a web / technology consulting business focused on non-Profits and Higher Education. Since 2007 I have had a very successful freelance business. My primary client is <a href="http://www.cpd.utoronto.ca">Continuing Professional Development</a> at the University of Toronto. Working with a single large client has enabled me to help them deliver some really innovative solutions: WordPress network with over 89 sites; NodeJS API linked to their Event Management System; functional, mobile-friendly websites.</p>

<h3 id="whereiwanttobe.">Where I want to be.</h3>

<p>For the past 7 years I have been creating, designing, developing, deploying, and maintaining websites solo, with occasional designer-developer assistance. As technologies advance it has become more difficult remain the <em>expert generalist</em>. My curious and adventerous mind makes me constantly engage with personal development projects, conferences, and self-directed learning. I now want to leave my solo-freelance career to work with other developers, designers, intelligent and creative people.</p>

<h3 id="whatimreallylookingfor.">What I&#8217;m really looking for.</h3>

<p>You could be a creative agency with incredible clients; a startup with a great idea and fantastic talent; a non-profit trying to save the world from itself. My only requirement is that you&#8217;re passionate about your work. When I&#8217;m working for you, I&#8217;m passionate about what <strong>you</strong> do. </p>

<h3 id="okbutgivemeaforinstance.">OK, but give me a for instance.</h3>

<p>You need a developer, designer, feature owner who understands that this stuff has to ship, and that it must be used and understood by real people.</p>

<h3 id="meinonesentence:">Me in one sentence:</h3>

<p>I am the geek with a creative mind, and a creative mind with a developer&#8217;s sense of order. </p>
